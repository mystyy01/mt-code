need to implement a rename file on f2 and command palette

maybe a better terminal - autocompletion with oh-my-zsh if the user has it installed?

custom binds for the user to pick/change already existing
have users able to bind keys to either bash commands or command palette commands

need a custom bash command "open" in the .zshrc used in the config that hooks into the currently running mt-code process with that terminal and sends it a command to open a file
for example - open test.py
fires a message to the workspace in the same instance and it attempts to open test.py or create the file
